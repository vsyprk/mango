        <p><i>"The love is concealed in the moments that are a little too close for comfort, shrouded in awkwardness."</i></p> <!-- Short preview of the post -->

        <div id="post1" class="content"> 

            <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/michigan-in-color/hazel/">published to Michigan Daily</a>

            <p>My mom told me recently that getting Hazel (our dog, a tiny brown toy poodle) has made my dad gentler. It’s true. He baby talks to her, takes time out of his day to walk her and talks about her all the time. Upon hearing this, there was a gut reaction of jealousy. The dog coincidentally joining our family right as I left the house for college seemed like a cruel joke. On visits home, I watch my dad meticulously plan Hazel’s trips to the dog park and bathe her after with an uncharacteristic and unfamiliar tenderness. Why couldn’t my dad have become gentler for me? Was I not once just as much of an innocent creature in need of love? But, inexplicably, these feelings never manifest into resentment. One reason, obviously, is that Hazel is the cutest dog ever and I have nothing but love for her. The other reason is that I think I can feel in my bones how good she is for him. 

                To see my dad shrouded in love for another is a rare sight. He has never shown much affection to me, my mom or his parents. I’ve always been told, “Of course he loves you!” but the sheer frustration and emotional toll of having to assume that rather than be shown it was always too much. I didn’t understand how I was supposed to believe that I was loved by him with no basis of a kind gesture or words of appreciation, and my every attempt at connection being ignored. Every homemade birthday card being shoved into the bottom drawer, every conversation falling flat into disinterest and awkwardness. Instead I turned toward resenting him, which was easier. I would always blame him for our relationship — or rather, lack thereof. He was the older, wiser one; why couldn’t he put his ego aside and express his love? Even now, I don’t blame myself for my resentment. It’s undeniable that how he has treated me has hurt me.
                
                Yet, as I peer through a crack in the bedroom door, seeing my dad and Hazel curled up together with the same peaceful expression on their faces, I can’t help but simply feel overwhelmed by the amount of love I see. It’s clear to me how good it is for him to have something he can express love towards. I understand it’s no longer about me or the resentment I held towards him. It heals me a little bit just to see that he has this potential for love inside of him. I can start to see hints of love in the moments I thought were anything but that.
                
                The love is concealed in the moments that are a little too close for comfort, shrouded in awkwardness. When I stayed up all night making a Father’s Day cake for him, only to be met with laughter, I now know that was the only reaction he knew, and that there are hints of appreciation in it. I know we both feel a little too seen when my mom and all our relatives point out how similar we are, from our looks to our sense of humor, knowing that we will never talk about the fact. And yet, there is love in knowing we share so much. It’s hard to have a conversation that lasts more than two sentences, but there is love in the fact that we keep trying to start one, even if he only knows how to talk about school or work. The disconnect won’t disappear overnight, I know. There is still so much unsaid. But despite all the angst and misgivings, the love he shows Hazel reveals the love he has for me at the core of our relationship.
                
                It truly shakes me to my core to admit to myself that I love my dad and he loves me, but once again, I will not turn to resentment. The hurt is there, but that’s OK. I can have compassion; compassion for the tiny brown toy poodle who doesn’t realize she immediately got the love I have craved for 18 years, compassion for the father whose heart I still intricately understand despite it never being opened to me. The younger versions of me didn’t know how to do anything but blame and resent, but I realize now that if my dad can show love to Hazel, that love must be inside him, and some of that love must exist for me, no matter how mangled it may be by our fatherhood and daughterhood.</p> <!-- Full blog post content -->

        <p><i>maybe about loneliness, maybe about love</i></p> <!-- Short preview of the post -->

        <div id="post2" class="content">
            <p>i’m not sure how you expect me to believe
                that i am something more than the sum of my parts.
                i just don’t know where the whole soul thing 
                came into the equation but it's probably
                either nature or nurture like everything else.
                
                somewhere along the lines of birthday party 
                invitations and justified anger that i’m not sure is justified now
                i found that being good is actually quite difficult.
                i think there's a rulebook somewhere on 
                the tallest shelf but my arm doesn’t quite reach and i
                don't want to get dust on my hand.
                
                i might like bookstores better than libraries-
                they have less dust and the scent of books is 
                stronger there and i like that (everyone thinks they’re special
                when they say that) or maybe it’s that i don’t like how 
                the books at the library are filled with 
                endings someone already read.
                why didn’t you put a stop to it
                why didn’t you say something
                
                did you know it’s easier to throw people away when you 
                fold them up neatly rather than crumple them?
                i think i'm the worst person that ever lived but
                you sit next to me and tell me the same thing
                so i guess that means one of us is lying.
                i would cut myself up and take some of your 
                nauseating pity just so you would hold me 
                in your arms for a single minute
                so i guess that means we are both loved.
                and everyone knows you’re
                useless if not loved (unless you’re understood
                but everyone knows by now that’s a myth
                and even if it was real who said you deserved it?)
                but how does anyone love knowing that:
                it only exists in the absence of time and that unconditional love
                says more about the person giving it than the person 
                getting it and that you could hold anyone's face 
                long enough and think it tells the truth?
                all that i can ask for anymore is a memory i wouldn’t want to throw away
                
                it’s terrifying that one day i will have to be okay with just myself
                
                it’s too late to go into detail
                and there’s too much to explain
                and so i will tell you i love you
                and hope you understand the unsaid bits
                ever since i stopped believing in god i've given my faith to the silliest people</p> <!-- Full blog post content -->

        <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/michigan-in-color/prove-me-wrong/">published to Michigan Daily</a>

        <div id="post2" class="content">
            <p>Me and love, specifically the romantic kind, have been at odds with each other for as long as I can remember. Of course I now know that other kinds of love hold just as much importance, but I think something about being an only child and not having friends in middle school messed with my brain chemistry from an early age. I held romantic love on a pedestal, constantly in search of an elusive “soulmate,” and the idea that someone could complete me or fix me became my saving grace. In my childhood, this resulted in comically intense crushes, limerence being a constant state of mind, always infatuated by someone. Looking back, I’m still unsure if I was a hopeless romantic or simply lonely.

                Later, as I navigated my first “relationships,” I started to regard love in a different light. High school dating was nothing like the fairytales I had created in my head, and I began to think that maybe love should be more practical than magical. I threw away the idea of a soulmate completely, dumbing it down to a myth or fairytale, something I should grow up and stop believing in like a little kid’s faith in Santa Claus. I refused to let love take control of me in the way it had before, that was embarrassing and behind me now. In fact, I started to think I could outsmart it. Love was the biggest maze and logic was the map, I thought. If I could figure out all the algorithms and mechanisms behind it, it would never catch me by surprise. I would never again be love’s fool.
                
                A lot of this sounds like a defense mechanism, and I’m sure a part of it was, but I attribute a lot of it to my personality and how I prioritize thinking above feelings. I hated that people “in love” were unable to name exactly what they liked about the person in question. Indignant, I vowed to write down everything I liked about the people I claimed to love, as if I was preparing some premise and argument to reach a conclusion of love. I would scoff at friends who claimed to be “in love” when it was so obvious they were simply attached because of physical affection or the idea of them. I also forbid myself from ever seriously talking about marriage or anything about a “forever” in my relationships, insisting that love was something of its own force with its own will and could only be temporary by nature, that it would only be permanent if someone could prove me wrong. 
                
                As my relationships started to get more serious, however, my avoidance of anything permanent started to become a pattern, and the way I was treating each relationship as a philosophical thesis was probably getting annoying to everyone involved. My theories were preventing myself from getting hurt, but I was no happier with love, and there was no conclusion in sight to all my “research.” Worst of all, I was starting to have to admit to myself that deep down, I still longed for a soulmate kind of love.
                
                is the love from your soulmate a warm embrace that only feels right after decades of building walls, each distracted with life? or is it something that appears unassuming at first, insisting for more and more attention until you can’t ignore how its roots have intertwined with yours? is it an all consuming moment, fate’s own personal gamble, something historians can’t shut up about? is it the prize at the end of the tunnel, the secret ingredient not being waited on? something you cultivated yourself, planted, sowed, watered, harvested, with hard work and patience? something to be strictly observed, until there is no feasible flaw, a logic that transcends human intelligence, a perfect circle making its infinite loop? is it a tangled mess, a knotted jumble of chaos and misfortunes? the single gem you find in the midst of that exact clutter, a needle in a haystack, a pearl out of a million oysters? is it innocent, young, something we clutch at right out of the womb? is it old, wise, something we must survive a journey of life for? something shared amongst everyone, something that ties everyone together? is it only given to a select few, those that karma and god have decided deserve it?
                
                There’s an intrinsic difference between being loved as a human and being loved as yourself. Maybe that was what drew me to romantic love specifically; the love your parents and friends have for you somehow transcends who you are, looking past your mistakes and everything ugly. But to me, the core of romantic love has always been being seen. In my romantic relationships, simply being loved as a human was not enough for me, and I hated myself for it. I felt like I was asking for too much, unappreciative and ungrateful, like I was expecting someone to be my soulmate when I was simultaneously telling myself those didn’t exist. I hated when the love I received seemed unconditional, because I always believed that unconditional love was more a positive reflection of its giver than me as the receiver, and it meant it wasn’t unique to me. I wasn’t exactly sure what a love unique to me would feel like, but I knew it would simultaneously transcend any tangible explanation and answer all my burning questions about love.
                
                Eventually, I started to feel panicked that maybe this true love didn’t exist, and my anxiety caused me to try and cheat love, shortcutting intimacy, being a little too vulnerable in a desperate attempt to be seen and maybe understood. The understanding I did manage to find was warped and twisted, predictably lacking the trust, warmth and care you nurture in a long-term relationship. Feeling understood without being loved was the loneliest feeling in the world. I wondered if there was something so wrong with me that I could not be both understood and loved. Maybe there was something wrong with everything I was making love to be. Maybe the point to which I had overanalyzed love was too much, and now it was inaccessible to me.
                
                And so, I confess that I actually still believe in soulmates to a guy on the fourth or so date in the middle of a crowded subway in the heart of Seoul because what do I have to lose? It’s never going to work out because he goes to school in Boston and I feel slightly bad because I feel like he still really likes me already but too bad, love is not real anyways. I make my Santa Claus metaphor, that it’s more about faith than belief, but at least I know it’s baseless. He tells me soulmates are in fact not real, I say I know, and I ask how he’s so sure about me then. He continues to explain that it’s not about being destined to be with someone, but recognizing when you meet someone that you’re never going to meet again and doing everything in your power to make it work. He tells me he doesn’t know how but he feels that with me and that makes all the effort worth it. And then something clicks. 
                
                One of my favorite poems of all time is called “Loving Like An Existentialist” by Savannah Brown. When I first read it, it was a way for me to make peace with no longer believing in soulmates, but it holds a different meaning for me now. 
                
                “i wasn’t drawn to you
                
                because our wings are both blue
                
                but because they’re the same colour
                
                as everyone else’s
                
                and you were willing to listen to
                
                why that scared me”
                
                The poem rejects the traditional idea of a soulmate, questioning “wrenching claims of meant-to-be” with the simple response, “I don’t think so.” Brown continues by emphasizing the romance of love that is not bound by prophecy. I think the poem didn’t stick to me the first time I heard it because I didn’t realize how rare and special someone “willing to listen to why that scared me” is. The poem doesn’t suggest that this “existentialist” kind of love is any easier to find than another, just represents it as something underappreciated. 
                
                If what I was doing was constructing an algorithm, I had failed to consider a crucial human element. I believe some things about love are within our control, but I do think there’s a certain almost metaphysical aspect of it that cannot ever be quantified that I had forgotten to consider. For me, it was the way my boyfriend had almost immediately recognized not just me, but my soul. I still don’t believe in love at first sight, and I know understanding someone completely takes time, but there was a kind of recognition so indescribable yet tangible I just had to admit, even if he lives a flight away, and I am a broke college student. Even before someone gets the chance to truly understand you, there’s the premonition that they have the potential to, and that is the wonderful part of it all.
                
                Sometimes I wish I met him earlier, to save myself the trouble, but at the end of the day I believe all my ordeals and theories have led to me recognizing him. There’s this otherworldly unshakeable feeling of “you just get it” at our core, but everything else just falls into place: his kindness, his ambition, the utmost care and respect with which he talks about his parents, sisters and friends, and the way I’ve felt like the truest and best version of myself since I’ve met him, all things I’ve learned to notice and appreciate through countless failed theories. (There’s also the feeling that all the vocabulary in the world will not be enough to capture just how much I feel for him, but this will have to do for now.) The ways in which he proves my newest theories right is almost unnecessary because I already know, but he does it anyway. He doesn’t need to prove that he can understand me, but he reads my entire blog unprompted and talks to me about each post. He doesn’t need to prove his certainty or commitment, but he shows up with flowers to every airport greeting anyways. And he proves me wrong, everyday, by loving me and understanding me, unknowingly undoing my every doubt and uncertainty about love. 
                
                with every passing day he proves me wrong and right in the best way possible, and everything just makes sense.
                
                As Lana Del Ray sang in the song Margaret, of course, “When you know, you know.” This line rings true to many people because it embraces the abstract nature of true love. Love when I first got to know it felt like something divine to me, the way countless songs were written about it, the things people would do for it despite not being able to define it, and I had forgotten about it somewhere along the way, because breaking it down into more digestible parts seemed safer. The thing that makes it magical is that through generations upon generations of language and culture, it remains undefinable but immediately recognizable. You try and try, write poems, make art, but it escapes your fingertips at the very last second and you accept that. You don’t set out traps for it, or try to memorize its eating and sleeping patterns so you know just when to strike, naively thinking you can catch it to dissect it. You embrace it and thank it for coming. </p> <!-- Full blog post content -->

        <p><i>my take on the masculinity in my life</i></p> <!-- Short preview of the post -->

        <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/michigan-in-color/why-do-women-say-they-hate-all-men/">published to Michigan Daily</a>

        <div id="post2" class="content">
            <p>“I hate all men.”

                It’s a phrase that is so commonly thrown around in modern conversations, much to the ridicule and scoffing of young men. How could a woman, surely one with a father, or a brother, or even a boyfriend, claim that all men are inherently bad? 
                
                To preface, this phrase is not a personal attack on literally every man to exist, but more so a criticism on how men have harmed many women around the world as a whole. Granted, I’ve experienced the phrase being thrown around irresponsibly with little to no explanation on its implications. When it’s framed as a joke or a throwaway statement at the end of a rant about your best friend’s ex–boyfriend, it becomes even more difficult to take it seriously. I understand how this could be annoying, but I believe despite that, there is a necessary conversation to be had about this sentiment, joke or no joke.
                
                I believe the message at the core of this phrase is a criticism of masculinity, or rather, toxic masculinity. Unfortunately, toxic masculinity has become a buzzword that often deters individuals from having serious and nuanced conversations about the patriarchy without being laughed at by men. “Toxic” is a subjective term in this context, and “masculinity” is arguably even more complicated. In the context of this piece, the masculinity I reference is what I am most familiar with, which is limited to a Western cultural context and a cis-heteronormative perspective. While it would be ideal to discuss these issues in broader, more inclusive contexts, so many of us operate under these restrictive frameworks, so a conversation limited by this is still necessary. 
                
                If you ask women what toxic masculinity is to them, many of their experiences overlap. When masculinity starts to hurt people, whether through harming women directly or by perpetuating harmful ideals that influence men to hurt themselves or those around them, it becomes toxic masculinity. Toxic masculinity looks like men tying their self-worth into how many women sleep with them, in turn ruining genuine connections with women because of this idea that fails to see women as people. I see it in day-to-day life, in the workplace and friend groups alike, when women are talked over, ignored, mansplained to and called unfunny because the roles that build up men also bring women down.
                
                The problem is that it’s hard to define where the “toxic” ends and the “masculinity” begins. A classic example is when the check comes at the end of a date between a man and woman. A man paying for the meal is a traditionally masculine chivalrous act, but it comes with implications. Should financial dynamics in relationships stay conservative to preserve masculinity? Traditionally, the man provides while the woman takes on the role of the caretaker, but if the woman starts to work and provide for herself, does this alleviate the man’s role as a “provider?” Or, if the woman is making her own money, should the bill now be split since both parties are taking on the “providing,” or should the man pay even more since the woman is shouldering some of his weight as a provider? Obviously these issues should be discussed in whatever relationship you choose to be in, but it illustrates my point that the line at which chivalry crosses over to harmful patriarchal ideals is hard to find. 
                
                When looking for a “healthy” example of masculinity, one that most quickly comes to mind is sports, though it should be noted sports are not inherently masculine. Men bond with other male friends over sports, rooting for the same team, watching games together. But from the perspectives of my female friends and I, it’s hard to separate this “respectable” hobby from “locker room talk” horror stories, when women are objectified and treated as conquests. The disrespect is often less extreme than that, though—almost all of my female friends who have even half an interest in Michigan football have an experience of a man brushing off their knowledge of the teams or how the game works.  Just like that, a traditionally masculine and wholesome hobby could easily be used to put down women and rob them of their dimensionality and thus, become toxic. 
                
                The same blurriness between toxic masculinity and masculinity is the gray area between “some men” and “all men.” I think this is what underlies the sentiment that causes “some men are bad” to become “all men are bad.” The uncertainty makes it hard to decipher when masculinity is good and when it is bad, and misogyny is unrelenting. Women cannot simply ignore or take a break from men or their masculinity, toxic or not, when it is present in our loved ones, our family, friends, significant others. It is tiring, exhausting. It is easier to believe that it is all men, to prevent the hurt that might come if we put ourselves in a vulnerable position in an attempt to believe otherwise. 
                
                Over the summer, I read the book “The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love” by bell hooks. Reading the experiences written in the book made me feel understood in my anger, but hooks’ analysis was also surprisingly kind toward not only men as a whole but also toward the men who had personally hurt her. This made a small part of me upset because I have always hated the idea that it is the woman’s responsibility to educate the man. I have memories of trying to explain to former guy friends why something they said was rude or misogynistic, only to be misunderstood or called sensitive. How cruel is it to ask the victims of the societal imbalance of misogyny to explain to their perpetrator what they did wrong? It seems inhumane and unrealistic that a woman is made responsible for teaching a man all these things, like a mother raising a son. Even a mother who intends to raise her son properly must face opposition from the rest of the world.
                
                And yet, reading hooks’ personal stories quickly showed me that she was not blind to the harmful effects of the patriarchy on women. Despite the hurt she has clearly faced from the men in her life, she emphasizes a need for change. Specifically, she states a need for men to learn to love. The overarching message is that women cannot dismantle the effects of the patriarchy alone. However, as hooks explains, “Within the early writings of radical feminism, anger, rage, and even hatred of men was voiced, yet there was no meaningful attempt to offer ways to resolve these feelings, to imagine a culture of reconciliation…Militant feminism…did not allow us to talk about what it meant to love men in patriarchal culture, to know how we could express that love without fear of exploitation and oppression.”
                
                It is important to remember that misogyny is what prevents healthy relationships between men and women, not something that means men and women cannot share a community. It creates mistrust and anxiety within these relationships, whether it be romantic, platonic, or parental. It’s what makes women feel unheard and ignored even if the man feels he is listening. It’s what makes sex an act of power for the man and an act of submission for the woman. It’s what creates power imbalances that fester resentment, secrecy, and misunderstandings. Ultimately, it’s not men versus women, but men and women versus misogyny.
                
                Hooks writes, “Men do oppress women. People are hurt by rigid sexist role patterns. These two realities coexist. Male oppression of women cannot be excused by the recognition that there are ways men are hurt by rigid sexist roles. Feminist activists should acknowledge that hurt, and work to change it — it exists. It does not erase or lessen male responsibility for supporting and perpetuating their power under patriarchy to exploit and oppress women in a manner far more grievous than the serious psychological stress and emotional pain caused by male conformity to rigid sexist role patterns.” I quote this because I do not want my expression of my empathy to counter my original point. Misogyny forces women to become small, and men to become so big they’ll break anything in their path. hooks begs the reader to consider that perhaps the men are not taught to be anything but big. 
                
                Women say that they hate all men because the effects of misogyny are so deeply rooted they have made it difficult to differentiate the kinds of masculinity they should respect versus the kind they should hate. I empathize deeply with the sentiment, from lived and observed experiences alike. I believe it is not only kind but extremely necessary for men to understand the feelings that lie underneath the phrase, to start from a place of empathy. In turn, however, I believe any conversation that will result in change must consider how the patriarchy has failed not only women but also men. 
                
                So no, I don’t actually hate all men, but the anger generated by the phrasing of it is a symptom of the real problem at hand.
