            <p>i’m not sure how you expect me to believe
                that i am something more than the sum of my parts.
                i just don’t know where the whole soul thing 
                came into the equation but it's probably
                either nature or nurture like everything else.</p>
                
            <p> somewhere along the lines of birthday party 
                invitations and justified anger that i’m not sure is justified now
                i found that being good is actually quite difficult.
                i think there's a rulebook somewhere on 
                the tallest shelf but my arm doesn’t quite reach and i
                don't want to get dust on my hand.</p>
                
            <p> i might like bookstores better than libraries-
                they have less dust and the scent of books is 
                stronger there and i like that (everyone thinks they’re special
                when they say that) or maybe it’s that i don’t like how 
                the books at the library are filled with 
                endings someone already read.
                why didn’t you put a stop to it
                why didn’t you say something</p>
                
            <p> did you know it’s easier to throw people away when you 
                fold them up neatly rather than crumple them?
                i think i'm the worst person that ever lived but
                you sit next to me and tell me the same thing
                so i guess that means one of us is lying.
                i would cut myself up and take some of your 
                nauseating pity just so you would hold me 
                in your arms for a single minute
                so i guess that means we are both loved.
                and everyone knows you’re
                useless if not loved (unless you’re understood
                but everyone knows by now that’s a myth
                and even if it was real who said you deserved it?)
                but how does anyone love knowing that:
                it only exists in the absence of time and that unconditional love
                says more about the person giving it than the person 
                getting it and that you could hold anyone's face 
                long enough and think it tells the truth?
                all that i can ask for anymore is a memory i wouldn’t want to throw away</p>
                
            <p> it’s terrifying that one day i will have to be okay with just myself
                
            <p> it’s too late to go into detail
                and there’s too much to explain
                and so i will tell you i love you
                and hope you understand the unsaid bits
                ever since i stopped believing in god i've given my faith to the silliest people</p> <!-- Full blog post content -->
